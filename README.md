# BingCenter
A simple browser extension that makes all frequently used Bing.com pages centered, made for those *(I know, many)* people who like to maximize windows on a wide/ultrawide monitor. Oh, and it also gets rid of the annoying "unlock full potential" pop-up when opening Copilot *( you're welcome ;) )*.
### List of centered subpages
- Bing Search 🔍
- Bing AI / Copilot 🧠
- Bing Images 📷
- Bing Videos 🎥
- Bing News 📰
- Bing Shopping 🛒

### To do in the future
- Center more subpages, i.e. Settings, Profile, etc.
- Fix overlapping search field and nav menu when scrolling to Bing AI
- Fix Bing AI sometimes scrolling back to Search
- Add dark theme for Shopping tab
